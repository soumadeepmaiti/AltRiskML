# Monotonic constraints for LightGBM
# +1  => model PD should be NON-DECREASING as the feature increases (higher -> higher risk)
# -1  => model PD should be NON-INCREASING as the feature increases (higher -> lower risk)
#  0  => no constraint (use when effect may be non-monotonic or feature is categorical/encoded)
#
# Notes:
# - Constraints apply only to continuous/ordered features. For label-encoded categoricals, keep 0.
# - Missing columns are ignored by the code; this file is a best-effort map.

# --- Financial capacity / buffers (more -> safer) ---
AnnualIncome: -1                 # higher income -> lower PD
MonthlyIncome: -1                # higher disposable income -> lower PD
TotalAssets: -1                  # more assets -> lower PD
NetWorth: -1                     # higher net worth -> lower PD
SavingsAccountBalance: -1        # larger cushion -> lower PD
CheckingAccountBalance: -1       # more liquidity -> lower PD
JobTenure: -1                    # longer tenure -> lower PD
Experience: -1                   # more years of experience -> lower PD
UtilityBillsPaymentHistory: -1   # better payment history metric -> lower PD (assumed higher=better)

# --- Indebtedness / burden (more -> riskier) ---
LoanAmount: +1                   # larger principal -> higher PD
LoanDuration: +1                 # longer term -> higher PD (more uncertainty)
MonthlyDebtPayments: +1          # higher existing obligations -> higher PD
TotalLiabilities: +1             # more liabilities -> higher PD
TotalDebtToIncomeRatio: +1       # higher DTI -> higher PD
MonthlyLoanPayment: +1           # higher scheduled payment -> higher PD (affordability)

# --- Rates / pricing (usually post-decision; constrain only if kept) ---
BaseInterestRate: +1             # higher base rate often aligns with higher risk
InterestRate: +1                 # higher priced loans tend to be riskier

# --- Demographics & possibly non-monotonic relationships ---
Age: 0                           # effect can be U-shaped; leave unconstrained

# --- Categorical features (do NOT apply monotone constraints) ---
EmploymentStatus: 0              # categorical
EducationLevel: 0                # categorical
MaritalStatus: 0                 # categorical
HomeOwnershipStatus: 0           # categorical
LoanPurpose: 0                   # categorical
NumberOfDependents: 0            # could be monotone (+1) but not strictly so; leave 0

# --- Pricing/derived (often post-decision; set to 0 if excluded) ---
BaseInterestRate: +1
